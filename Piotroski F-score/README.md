# 📊 Piotroski F-Score Backtesting – B3 (2019–2025)

This project applies the **Piotroski F-Score** strategy to the Brazilian stock market (**B3**), evaluating annual investment portfolios from **2019 to 2025**. The goal is to assess how portfolios composed of companies with different F-Score levels perform when compared to the **IBOVESPA** index.

## 🧠 What is the F-Score?

The **Piotroski F-Score** is a fundamental analysis metric used to measure a company’s financial strength based on **9 accounting signals**, divided into three categories:

- **Profitability**
- **Leverage and Liquidity**
- **Operating Efficiency**

Each signal contributes 1 point if it meets a predefined criterion, producing a total score from **0 to 9**. Higher scores indicate stronger financial health.

## 🔬 What was tested?

Annual portfolios were simulated using companies with F-Scores ranging from **0 to 9**, tested **individually**. For each base year, companies with the exact target score and sufficient average trading volume were selected to build an **equally weighted portfolio** for the following year.

These portfolios were benchmarked against the **IBOVESPA** index performance.

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- Portfolios based on **F-Scores 7 and 8** consistently outperformed the IBOV.
- Low-score portfolios (**F-Scores 0 to 3**) underperformed and often destroyed shareholder value.
- The **COVID-19 crisis (2020)** was highlighted to visualize how different scoring strategies reacted under stress.
